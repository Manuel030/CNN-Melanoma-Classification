# CNN-Melanoma-Classification

Technial report alongside code for Machine Learning by Prof. â€ªLyudmila Grigoryeva @University Konstanz. In this project, 
we exploit a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet synset and adapt it's architecture
to the task of melanoma classification.

# CNN-Melanoma-Classification

Technial report alongside code for Machine Learning by Prof. â€ªLyudmila Grigoryeva @University Konstanz. 

In this project, we exploit a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet synset and 
adapt it's architecture to the task of melanoma classification.
